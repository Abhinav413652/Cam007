# Cam007
It’s a secret cam… it’s very small and it can be hidden in a t shirt or a cap!!

## Project Description
I am building a wearable security camera hidden inside a cap. It uses a Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 Sense because it is tiny enough to fit in wherever I want... The battery and wires will be tucked inside the sweatband so it looks like a normal cap from the outside. Or I'll have in my t-shirt pocket... yes 007 is James Bond reference!! and it wont be visible to people in plain sight...

It runs a web server that streams video directly to my phone's browser over local Wi-Fi, so I can record hands-free without needing the internet. I am taking help of gemini to make this project... the Idea was mine but I'll take its help for the code etc... (I'm preparing for an engineering college... and it's my first project!!)... 

## Hardware List

### Core Components
- **Main Board:** Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 Sense (chosen for its tiny size and camera)
- **Battery:** 3.7V 800mAh LiPo Battery (Flat pouch style to fit in the cap)
- **Switch:** Micro Slide Switch (SPDT)
- **Wiring:** Jumper wires
- **Insulation:** Heat Shrink Tubing

### Tools & Equipment

- **Consumables:** Solder Wire Spool (60/40 Tin/Lead)
